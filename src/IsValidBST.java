    /*
    * As a startup inventory management system, we need to validate the binary search tree data structure used to
    * store our inventory items. We have a root node of the binary tree which contains the item information such
    * as item ID, name, quantity, and price. We want to make sure that the binary search tree is valid and follows the
    * rules of a binary search tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
    * key and the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    *
    * Write a function that takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether
    * the tree is a valid binary search tree or not. The function should handle the case where the binary tree is empty.
