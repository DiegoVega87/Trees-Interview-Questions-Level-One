    * As a startup in the education industry, we want to create an online platform to help students learn programming.
    * We need a function that takes the root of a binary tree as input and checks whether the tree is a mirror of itself,
    * i.e. symmetric around its center. This will help us ensure that our binary tree exercises are correctly labeled
    * as symmetric or not. Can you implement a function that takes the root of a binary tree and returns true if the
    * tree is symmetric, false otherwise?
